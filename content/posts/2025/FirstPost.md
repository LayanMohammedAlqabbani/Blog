# How to achive the CIA triad ?
How to Achieve Information Confidentiality üîê? To ensure confidentiality, physical and technical control techniques can be used, such as: 
‚Ä¢ Physical control: Restricting access using tools like card readers or fingerprints. 
‚Ä¢ Technical control: Protecting data with firewalls and preventing unauthorized access using encryption. 
‚Ä¢ Applying the "Rule of Least Privilege" (ROLP): Giving each user (or process) the minimum level of privileges or access needed to perform their role or task. Example: An employee in the HR department can access salary data but cannot access the database.

 How to Achieve Information Integrity üîé? Information integrity can be achieved using some tools such as:
  ‚Ä¢ File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): To monitor and detect unauthorized changes. 
  ‚Ä¢ Relational Database Management (RDBM): To log data access and modifications.
  ‚Ä¢ Logs Monitoring: Regularly checking logs to ensure no suspicious activities are present.

  How to Achieve Information Availability ‚úÖ? To ensure availability, the following steps can be taken:
   ‚Ä¢ Data Backup: Creating backups and restoring them when needed. 
   ‚Ä¢ Firewalls and Data Encryption: Protecting systems to prevent disruptions caused by attacks.
   ‚Ä¢ Penetration Testing: Conducting penetration tests to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
