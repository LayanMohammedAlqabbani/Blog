# Access control Concepts:
‚Ä¢ Defense in Depthüîé: It is a term about layers of controls that provide benefits such as administrative control, technical control, and physical control; used to provide protection for assets and reduce risks to them. 

‚Ä¢ Privileged Accounts‚å®Ô∏è:These are accounts that are given privileged access to certain functions in systems. However, they require protection and auditing to prevent the authorized access from being exploited by the account owner for purposes that harm the system or the data associated with it.

 ‚Ä¢ RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)üë§: It is access and permissions control based on the user's role only; to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access to some sensitive resources in the system.
